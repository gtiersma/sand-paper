How a certain part of the terrain is shifted is dependant on the color of the corresponding part of the map.
More red will shift left. Less red will shift right.
More green will shift up. Less green will shift down.
More blue will shift forward. Less blue will shift backward.

It is best for beginners to create these maps by starting with an image with a black background and painting using only green at different opacities to raise certain areas by certain amounts. More advanced users may want to begin with a gray (R:127, G:127, B:127) background and then add or remove red, green or blue at different areas of the map to attain the desired shape.]]></text>

Bump maps technically do not change the shape of the terrain at all, but rather give the allusion of the shape changing slightly. It is useful for creating details on the surface such as bumps and cracks.

Sand Paper uses a type of colored bump map known as a normal map. These maps are difficult to create by hand, however, there are applications (such as GIMP) that are capable of applying a filter on the diffuse map to generate a normal map that can be used.]]></text>

The darker parts of the specular map will make the corresponding part of the terrain to be less reflective, and lighter areas will be more reflective.

A specular map is usually created from a grayscale version of the diffuse or bump map. After darkening and lightening different parts of the image, tints of color can be added to different areas of the map to add a tint of color to the reflection.]]></text>

By default, these planes always face the camera to help convey the allusion that they are 3D objects when a rendered image is created.

Populations are useful for creating trees, shrubery, poles, people in a crowd or other things that may stand up from the terrain's surface.

It can be tricky to make them look real in Sand Paper, so it's recommended to do adjustments on them in an image editor after rendering.
                
Large populations may be demanding on your PC (especially when the terrain has high vertex dimensions).]]></text>

A black area on the map will cover the corresponding area on the terrain with the population. A white area will make the corresponding area on the terrain void of the population. A gray area will be partially populated depending on how light or dark the gray area is.

These displacement maps function in the same manner as the terrain's displacement map. The difference is that each individual object in the population is given a displacement map generated at random with colors between what is seen in the 2 maps. This will give each object different (yet similar) displacement maps, thereby giving them somewhat different shapes.

If this is difficult to understand, think of one map as being the least of how much the vertices should be positioned, and the other is the most. Each vertex on each object in the population will be positioned based upon a random color between the range of the two maps.

To have each object in the population have the exact same shape, choose the same image for both of the maps.]]></text>
